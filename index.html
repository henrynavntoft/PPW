                <p>Born in 2000 in <span>Copenhagen, Denmark</span>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am a firm believer that web design should be <span>simple </span>, easy to understand, and
                    functional.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My goal is to contribute my young and <span>unbiased</span> perspective to make existing designs
                    even
                    more effective and <span>user-friendly</span>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am passionate about improving and optimising web experiences, and I aspire to help create digital
                    spaces that are both <span>intuitive</span> and <span>visually appealing</span>.
                    <br>

                <h3>North Folk</h3>
                <p>North Folk is a responsive website that showcases a folk music band. As the main developer on this
                    project, I coded the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, working closely with the design team to
                    ensure that the site accurately reflected the band's style and sound. I implemented various
                    interactive features, such as a responsive navigation menu, a music player, and a contact form.

            <div>
                <h3>Copenhagen Cartel</h3>
                <p>The landing page I created is designed to engage a younger audience by showcasing a fun and
                    interactive brand that resonates with their interests and values. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I
                    crafted a visually appealing and dynamic website that captures the attention of the target audience.
